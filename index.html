        <h1>Peter Parker spider-man is better then Miles Morales spider-man</h1>
        <p class="nv2">Spider-Man has been an iconic superhero for decades, with Peter Parker being the original and most recognized version of the character. While Miles Morales brings fresh energy and diversity to the Spider-Man legacy, Peter Parker remains the superior Spider-Man due to his depth of character, long-standing history, and greater influence on the Marvel universe.

            <br>Peter Parker’s journey is deeply rooted in responsibility and sacrifice. His origin story, losing Uncle Ben and learning that "with great power comes great responsibility," has shaped his character in a way that resonates with fans across generations. Unlike Miles, who inherits the mantle of Spider-Man, Peter had to struggle, invent, and evolve entirely on his own.
            
            <br>Additionally, Peter has fought some of the most dangerous villains in comic book history, from the Green Goblin to Doctor Octopus, proving his resilience and intelligence time and again. His experience and determination make him a more seasoned and compelling hero compared to Miles.
            
            <br>While Miles Morales is an exciting and capable Spider-Man in his own right, Peter Parker’s legacy, character development, and impact make him the definitive Spider-Man. His story remains the gold standard of what it means to be a hero.</p>
